Everyone knows `j` and `k` will move you up and down a line in Vim. But did you
know there's a simple way to move to the next blank line in Vim?

Vim allows easy navigation to the next paragraph, method, or other blank line
separation with the `}` (right curly brace) character. Similarly, `{` (left
curly brace) will take you back to the previous paragraph, function, method, or
other blank line separation.

(Incidentally, you may also be interested to know that _{}_ are variously called
just "braces" in some areas but also: French brackets, curly brackets, definite
brackets, swirly brackets, curly braces, birdie brackets, Scottish brackets,
squirrelly brackets, gullwings, seagulls, squiggly brackets, twirly brackets,
Tuborg brackets, accolades, pointy brackets, third brackets, fancy brackets,
water buffalo brackets, or longhorn steer brackets<sup>1</sup>.)

Go forth and move through files even faster!
