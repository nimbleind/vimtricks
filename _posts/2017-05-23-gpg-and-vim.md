To transparently work with files encrypted with gnupg, use jamessan's
[vim-gnupg](https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg) plugin.  Once installed and
active it will decrypt/ encrypt the file when reading and writing.

Additionally, creating a new file with extensions including ".gpg, ".pgp", or
".asc" will prompt for the recipient and encrypt for said recipient.
