I'm constantly surprised at the things I don't know with vim.  Today I wanted to
open a URL contained in a buffer.  I looked at the mouse scathingly.  Sure I can
cmd-click the URL in iTerm2 as I've done so many times before. Not today!  A
quick google search yielded `gx`.  It behaves like `gf` which opens the file
under the cursor except with URLs and the browser.
